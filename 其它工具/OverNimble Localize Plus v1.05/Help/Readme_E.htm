<p>The software is a localization tool, work in "Visual Localize", "Restorator", "Language Localizator" to implement the perfact localization. By using the special way for C, VB, Delphi and text resource, the functions of convenient version upgrading and dictionary processing, it will help you get twice the results with half the efforts. The software offers three language options: English, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese. It also supports your addition of other languages.
<p>This software can be run in Win95/98/Me/NT4/2000. On windows 95 or windows nt4, vb5 runtime is required to install. It can be downloaded from microsoft's web site: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/vb50pro/Utility/1/WIN98/EN-US/MSVBVM50.EXE">MSVBVM50.EXE</a> or our web site: <a href="http://www.overnimble.com/download/MSVBVM50.EXE">MSVBVM50.EXE</a>.

<p>The software is mainly designed for localization of non-resource formats; although it is also usable for localization of resource formats, it cannot conduct replacement of character strings that are larger than the source ones. In that case, we recommend that you use tools such as Visual C++ and ResHacker instead.
<p>There are instructions for each interface of the software. Please read these instructions before using its functions.
<p>Both the "reference file" and "dictionary file" mentioned in all the functions neglect blank lines, so you may add blank lines as you like. However, lines with only spaces are not treated as blank lines. The other lines in the "reference file" are repeated in the following format:
<pre>
         Offsets:source string
         Modified string
</pre>
<p>"Offsets" are presented in decimal. Generally, they are automatically given by the program and do not need any modification by the user. So it is with "source strings".
<p>The other lines in the "dictionary file" are repeated in the following format:
<pre>
         Source string
         Modified string
</pre>
<p>Similarly, "source strings" are automatically written by the program and do not need any modification by the user.
<p>What's more, no replacements of executable files can conduct such as are longer than the source strings. If the modified strings are longer than the source ones, the program will automatically cut down the modified strings to ensure that they are equal to the source ones in length. Otherwise, the spaces will be filled up with "00" in hexadecimal or BLANKs <font color="#008888">(by selecting "Supply by space" on the "Replace strings" interface)</font> .
<p>All reference files obtained by means of "Unlimited" will need the user to eliminate the illegal items; otherwise errors will occur in conducting replacement.
<p>For programs compiled in VB or Delphi, because they have a string length counter, the dedicated searching and replacement functions they provide can not only improve the precision of search, but also make better the compatibility of replaced programs.
<p>The tool assumes the following: the extension name of UniCode reference files in VB format is ".txt", that of ASCII reference files in Delphi format is ".d.txt", that in UniCode format is ".u.txt", and that in ASCII format ".a.txt". The formats of the four types of reference files are thus the same. The program will identify the type of a file according to its name. Although users are allowed to change the type, it is recommended that the assumed extension names be adopted.
<p>Since the program checks on the source strings while conducting replacement, your wrong choice of the type usually will not cause irreversible consequences. However, it is better to be cautious.
<p>In searching UniCode and ASCII, there is no prefix used for judgment flags. If the actual length of a string is larger than the maximum length that is chosen, a "right interception" method is adopted. For instance, suppose the maximum length chosen is 3, then the actually string "Text" should be right intercepted as "ext".
<p>For the strings include RETURN and NEW-LINE, using replacement mode to dispose:
<pre>
         RETURN   replaced as \r
         NEW-LINE replaced as \n
         \        replaced as \\
         "        replaced as \"
         Tab      replaced as \t
</pre>
<p>In translating new versions, you may either use the "dictionary file" or the "reference file". From the latter, one can also obtain a "dictionary file" by using the "partitioning reference file" function of the "offset mode".
<p>The program does not provide a status bar to indicate the status of searching. However, the user can estimate the searching time himself/herself. The measurement data on P200 are as follows: the UniCode <font color="#008888">(include VB)</font> searching speed is 1MB/s, while that of ASCII <font color="#008888">(include Delphi)</font> is 0.5MB/s.
<p>VA mode can increase veracity, can search other languages like Chinese, Japanese and so on. Use "VA UnCtrlSign" to search string not include control signs <font color="#008888">(but still search return,new-line,tab)</font> . Now you can select "Debar overlap" let it auto debar overlap items or deleted them by yourself.
<p>Using "If can replace" mode, you can get the strings what will be complated replace and what will be intercepted. In this mode, it will be created two files: "*.ok" and "*.not".
