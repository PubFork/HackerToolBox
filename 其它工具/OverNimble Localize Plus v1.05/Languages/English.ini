30000="English and Signs" mode, for searching English words and signs only (configured in ".ini" files); while "Unlimited" is used for searching character strings in other languages and takes it legal so long as the strings do not include "00". But some illegal strings may occur. In such cases, please eliminate these illegal reference items while editing.

30001=There are 4 options of replacement mode: VB String, UniCode, ASCII and Delphi String. Choose the right one. If the number of translated words is bigger than that of the original strings, it will be automatically cut down; otherwise, fill it with "00" or spaces (by selecting "Supply by space"). For VB or Delphi strings, their length identifiers are also modified.
30002=The function employs the ".txt" editor within Windows to edit the reference files. If not otherwise set, the default editor is Notepad. We recommend that you replace it with other editors. Note that blank lines are free to add or eliminate at will, but the odd lines in the formal file can not be modified, otherwise unexpected errors may occur.
30003=When partitioning files, the "Offset mode" partitions a file into an "offset file" and a "dictionary file", while the "Trans term mode" does that in accordance with odd lines or even lines. The partitioned files can be processed with other tools, but you cannot change their sequences or insert any line, otherwise they cannot be amalgamated. Using "if can replace" mode you will need to keep the origin order.
30004=The amalgamation function amalgamates the partitioned files. Only the destination file name is selected. The user must ensure that the destination file name is appended with ".off" or ".dic"(using offset mode), or that the ".1" and ".2" (using trans term mode) or that the ".ok" and ".not"(using if can replace mode) files exist.
30005=The dictionary file may be either a reference file to the original version or a ".dic" file partitioned in the offset mode. The name of the reference file generally takes after the newly generated one. The function is used to Version upgrades with the original translations.
30006=The extension name of the reference file generated while searching UniCode should be defined as ".u.txt ". If it is not, you may reselect the program file or modify the extension name of the reference file, because there is no other way than using the extension name to indicate its type.VA mode can increase veracity and can search other languages like chinese, japanese...
30007=The extension name of the reference file generated while searching ASCII should be defined as ".a.txt ". If it is not, you may reselect the program file or modify the extension name of the reference file, because there is no other way than using the extension name to indicate its type.VA mode can increase veracity and can search other languages like chinese, japanese...
30008="Pre-define" is used to eliminate items already defined in "Pdef.dat". It is effective for elimination in version upgrading. "Eliminate the like items" is used for eliminating untranslated items. It makes it easier to browse. "Eliminate the blank lines" is widely compatible. Dictionary files can be edited with other tools after being properly processed.
30009="Normal" searches by line. Each line of the source file is treated as a reference item that will form a dictionary file rather than a reference file. If the destination text file is in the "INI" format(comparted by "="), please choose "INI" format (actually, most software using text resources to realize multilingual functions adopt the "INI" format).
30010=In the replacement of text resources, proper formats should be chosen to avoid errors. By the way, no matter it is a "Normal" or an "INI", if there are duplicated items in the dictionary file, priority should be given to the last item.

30011=Only after replacement has been conducted can you enter the software testing page and the maximum/minimum restrictions can be right. "Appoint replace" means the replacement of items between the maximum and minimum values (including the maximum and minimum items). "Test" means running the replaced executable files. "Restore" means returning to the pre-replaced executable files.

30012=Format conversion means the conversion between the reference files of 0.93 Version and those of previous versions. The 0.93 Version begins to use the conversion function of special characters so as to enable the searching of strings that include RETURN and NEW-LINE characters.
30013=Delphi string is a data type that begins with four "FF" and follows by a 4-byte length counter and an ASCIIZ string. This function is meant to search for such strings. (Note: not all Delphi strings are like this).
