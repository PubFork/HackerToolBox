This directory contains all the files needed to build the key generation
library on x86 *nix systems (tested on Debian and OpenBSD/FreeBSD).
Open the makefile to see how to compile the library.
A sample program which demonstrates how to load and call the
library is included as well.
Run
make keygen
to build the shared library and
make keygen_test
to build the example program.

Notes:
- To compile the sample application on BSD based systems,
  remove the option '-ldl' from the makefile.
- If you are using an old version of GCC you may have to
  uncomment the workaround in keygen_lib.cpp
