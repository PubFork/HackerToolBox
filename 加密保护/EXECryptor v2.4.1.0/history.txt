2.3.7		 28 Feb 2006
- bugfix: can't register ActiveX after protection
- bugfix: antidebug crash on Windows 9x

2.3.6		 22 Feb 2006
- bugfix: EXECryptor crash or create invalid PE while protecting dll

2.3.5		 19 Feb 2006
- bugfix: EXECryptor crash on Windows 2003
- bugfix: antidebug crash on Windows 2003

2.3.4		 16 Feb 2006
- bugfix: unregistered version crash
- bugfix: code transformation produces unsafe code
- fixed problem with "suspicious" false positive detection

2.3.3		 15 Feb 2006
- fixed problem with ClamAV false positive detection

2.3.2		 14 Feb 2006
- bugfix in EXECryptor GUI: 2.3 generates serial number with
  invalid userparam 

2.3.1		 10 Feb 2006
- bugfix: error "Application is not licensed to use this feature"
  while protecting Delphi application
- bugfix: EXECryptor leaves non standard named resources entries 
  uncompressed

2.3		  1 Feb 2006

NOTE: use new EXECryptor SDK's files with new version 2.3 and later. 
      This require program recompilation
- EXECryptor registration changed. you need use new serial numbers
- Now all license type can use trial restrictions function. To set 
  a trial period you can use current date or the application release 
  date. Binding to application release date allows to generate the 
  serial numbers valid for all software releases untill fixed date. 
  To use this feature switch in licenses editor and set llicenses 
  checking needed options in "Expire" menu.
- added full Unicode support for serial numbers. Using Unicode 
  registration names they are transformed in UTF-8 representation 
  and then are treated by relevant same-name ANSI functions. 
  As the representation of string that contains only latin characters 
  and digits in UTF-8 is the same as ANSI representation we have the 
  backward compatibility. new API function: VerifySerialNumberW
- added new API: DecodeSerialNumber. This function is analogic to 
  VerifySerialNumberEx, but it doesn't influence on IsRegistered, 
  RegConst_* result nor on CRYPT_REG/CRYPT_UNREG blocks execution. 
  This means the verification result is saved nowhere. You can use 
  it for additional serial numbers verification or when you need to 
  verify a serial number without any further program behaviour change. 
- added vrStolen in TVerifyResult for stolen key detection and custom action 
- eckeygen.dll updated for unicode support. changed interface of 
  CreateSerialNumberTimeLimit.
- added new feature: Advanced code protection. see help for more details.
- improved: new API function GetReleaseDate, GetEXECryptorVersion, 
  IsAppProtected
- improved: Unicode version of SecureRead/Write, Encrypt/DecryptStr
- improved: antidebug and multithreading
- bugfix: protected DLL change priority of mainthread to idle

            {$I crypt_end.inc}
          end;
          {$O+}   // restore
  MSVC:   
          #pragma optimize( "", off )   // disable optimization
          void func() {
          CRYPT_START
          ...
          CRYPT_END
          }
          #pragma optimize( "", on )   // restore
  C++Builder:
          #pragma option push
          #pragma option -Od   // disable optimization
          void func() {
          CRYPT_START
