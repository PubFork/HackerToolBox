;**********************************************************************
;Notes:
; The format of this file is fairly self explanitory, but here goes:
; 1.) keys appear in "[ ]"
; 2.) value names come before the "=" and values come after
; 3.) comments come after ";" (";" must be FIRST character of line!!)
;**********************************************************************
;Translation:
; Guidlines for translation are also self explanitory, but here goes:
; 1.) Do NOT do a word-for-word translation, you should make a user understand your 
;     translation easliy and correctly 
; 2.) Make sure your translation is about the same length as the english
;     translation for layout purposes. 
; 3.) Translate VALUES ONLY, do *NOT* translate *KEYS* or *VALUE NAMES*
; 4.) Do not translate these words:
;                1. <Enter>   ---this word will be replaced to ENTER(CR+LF) in program
;                2. the word after "%", such as "%.2d:%.2d","%New","%Open",etc. they
;                   also will be replaced in program.
; 5.) One line for one value, do not wrap the string, if you really need to wrap a long 
;     string, please use "<Enter>" instead. 
;
; 6.) Please keep language name in English.

Edit_FileToProtect_Tooltip=Open an EXE file which you want to protect.
Edit_NameOfProduct_Tooltip=Set a product name. The name used to select a locations where, on the user's<Enter>system, SDProtecor stores information about your program like trial counters,<Enter>it should be unique because another developer might also use it, or your program<Enter>and his will write over each others' information
Edit_CompanyName_Tooltip=Set your company name, it also can be used to select<Enter>a locations where SDProtecor stores information about<Enter>your program, but unlike Product Name, it can be blank<Enter>
Edit_VersionNum_Tooltip=Set a version number for your project. SDProtector<Enter>uses this value for trial mode if you use "Reset <Enter>trial period on new version" option and key limitation<Enter>if you has set "Expiration Version" value, be aware,<Enter>there is a limit on version, the maximum digits after<Enter>the decimal point is 4 ,and the version number can<Enter>only contain one decimal point, that is, you can not<Enter>enter one like 1.1.12 or 1.12345, the correct format<Enter>should be X.X, X.XX, X.XXX, X.XXXX
Edit_FileToSave_Tooltip=Set a file path for protected file. If you leave it blank,<Enter>SDProtector will overwrites the original file. But do not<Enter>forget to check option - "Create backup copy" if you<Enter>want to preserve the original file

Check_AntiApihook_Tooltip=make other programs can not hook your API
Check_AntiLoader_Tooltip=if enabled, it's much harder for some loaders to load your program
Check_IATRedirection_Tooltip=Available is so called "dump" of an image of protected file, but with<Enter>redirecting option selected practically impossible is rebuilding the<Enter>most important part of executable file which is import table, without<Enter>which execution of dumped program is not possible. Engine used in <Enter>SDProtector makes it impossible to rebuild import table, even in tools<Enter>specialized to such thing. Its strongly advised that this option is<Enter>always selected, for regular user it makes no difference but for an<Enter>intruder its a really brick wall which disallow a cracker to trace<Enter>executed WinApi functions and at the same time analyse program.
Check_IATRelocation_Tooltip=If enabled, some API addresses in import table will be relocated, import table<Enter>random relocation mechanism used in SDProtector makes it extremely difficult to<Enter>rebuild the image of executable file.
Check_ActiveProtection_Tooltip=This Option perform runtime protection, which protects the program not only<Enter>during start but always while its running. The idea is that if somebody runs<Enter>a utility that helps to crack the program application will be closed. This<Enter>method works by having two additional threads that are started by the appli-<Enter>cation and monitors if tools like Filemon and Regmon are not started
Check_StripReloc_Tooltip=Relocation section is an area of data mainly used in files of dynamic libraries<Enter>'.DLL'. In most executable files this section is not needed. Because SDProtector<Enter>supports only executable files '.EXE' its recommended to select this option<Enter>unless you get strange program behaviour/crashes
Check_UniqueInstance_Tooltip=If enabled, only unique instance is allowed while its running
Check_ProtectRes_Tooltip=If your turn this option on - SDProtector will compress and encrypt<Enter>application resources.
Check_CompressIcon_Tooltip=Compress icon resources in your program, It can make your program<Enter>smaller, but it can cause icons of some programs changed, in this<Enter>case, you may not check it<Enter><Enter>Tips: You can check this opition first, if the icon of your exe has not<Enter>been changed after protection, then it is applicable for your program
Check_ComressApp_Tooltip=If your program has already packed by other protector or <Enter>packer, SDProtector may fail to protect it, but if you check<Enter>this option, you have more opporunity of success.
Check_KeepExtraData_Tooltip=Certain compilers (e.g. FoxPro, Macromedia Authorware/Director) or special utilities<Enter>append code/data to the end of the executable. These programs may work only if the<Enter>'Preserve extra data' option is enabled
