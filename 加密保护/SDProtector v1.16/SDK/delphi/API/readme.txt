In order to run the compiled executable, you may need to click "generate keygen.dll" button in "Registration keys" tab to generate keygen.dll(you should use the same project file with the one which is used in protecting), and then copy it together with sdprotector.dll(in 'include' directory) to the directory with the compiled application before test.
