Template based mode-specific keys data generator.
Keys data generator uses your project file to generate a C or Delphi
language template that you can modify to create your own key generator.
Keys data generator produces the templates in C and Delphi formats only
and designed for Delphi and VC examples (Examples\KeyGen\), but you can
easily integrate it with your own examples. A template is a generated
"GenerateKey" routine that includes the function header and filled with
mode-specific information function body. In order to use it, you should
specify your project file, choose activation keys mode and press "Generate
Template" button.
