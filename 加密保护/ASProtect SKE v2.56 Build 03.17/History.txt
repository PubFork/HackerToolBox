  + Trial routine was updated. "GetTrialDays" API now works even if application running more than 1 day.
  + Added new project parameter - "cbDisableSubmitBtn". If this parameter 1 - submit button on the exception dialog will be disabled. 
    Default value is 0 (submit button enabled).
  + Added ClockBack support for time limited registration keys.
  + New log message will be displayed during protection routine, in case no default mode was found:

  * "CheckKeyAndDecrypt" API now returns FALSE, if registration key is valid, but key is BlackListed, Expred or HardwareID mismatch.
  * "CheckKey" API meaning was changed. Now it checks whether key is valid or not. If it is NOT valid - we should check TModeStatus 
    structure flags. TModeStatus structure filling always now, no matter what was the API result (true or false).
  * Removed #define IMPORT __declspec(dllimport) (aspr_api.h) line in order to avoid recompilation of modules
  * "IsModeActivated" flag added. It is TRUE, if three next flags are FALSE: IsWrongHardwareID, IsKeyExpired, IsBlackListedKey.
  * "IsKeyPresent" flag now means a little bit different behaviour now. It is TRUE, if any key (no matter valid or not) was installed 
    for the mode via CheckKey or CheckKeyAndDecrypt API (now or befor).
  * "GetRegistrationInformation" API header was changed. New parameter added - "ModeID : Byte".
  * New first parameter "ModeID : Byte" was added to the follows APIs:
    GetKeyDate
    GetKeyExpirationDate
    GetTrialDays
    GetTrialExecs
    GetExpirationDate
  * Default Trial messages will now be established during new modes creation.

  * Bug report send button disabled.

  - Fixed the bug with several NOPs (PoluBuffer problem)
  - Error in ASProtect IDE (Protection Error 171, cDataReadError) fixed
  - Fixed error 251 - (ASProtect own import run-time installing)
  - Fixed error 224
  - Fixed bug with different time zones (current date = key creation date - 1)
  - Fixed bug with project files without full path in command line.
  - Fixed bug with delay and reminder for registered modes.
  - Fixed bug in CGI modules. It ignores '+' (means ' ') in user name. 
  - Fixed error 174 message - text added: "(blacklisted key)".
  - Fixed bug with registered sections protection.
    For example, if protected application has any registered sections, but there are no modes for using these sections, all such sections 
    will be encrypted, but never decrypted at the run-time. The right behaviour is to not touch any sections that does not have corresponding 
    modes for using it.
  - Fixed: ASProtect.exe doesn't clear blacklist info after new project is loaded.
  - Fixed bug with Mode Name limits overflow
  - Fixed bug with equal source and destination file names (with "Create backup copy" option usage)
  - Fixed bug with Trial messages limits overflow
  - Fixed the problem with IsModeExpired flag. Expired Modes will not be activated anymore. Registered sections will not be decrypted for expired modes.
    IsModeActivated flag meaning was changed:
    If TRUE, selected mode is activated. Thus, IsKeyExpired IsBlackListedKey, IsWrongHarwareID and IsModeExpired flags must be FALSE.
  - Fixed bug with empty trial messages.
  - Fixed bug in PowerBuilder envelope checks
  - Fixed bug with blacklisted registration keys.
  - Fixed bug with CheckKey API
  - Fixed bug and memory leak in GetRegistrationKeys API 
  - Fixed bug in PolyBuffer ("ADC" instruction emulation).
  - Fixed bugs with KeygenIDE tool (added support for HardwareID and KeyExpiration fields)

    ASProtect 2.2 SKE build 06.05 Beta
    ==================================

  - Fixed the bug with VB applications during CheckKeyAndDecrypt API calling.
  - Fixed the problem with external key processing ("Cant process manager data" message)

  * Improved ASProtect trial protection algorithm against trial resetting tools.
  * Fixed some minors bugs
  * ASProtect protection level is improved
  * Fixed the problem with VB applications and modes processing
  * Fixed the problem with Import Table processing for big applications (more than 20Mb)
  * Fixed the problem with shared access to the keys storage file (aspr_keys.ini)
  * Fixed the problem with DLL memory leaks
  * Fixed the problem with error 158
  * Option name "Dont show messages when mode is expired" changed to "Don`t use built-in dialogs"
  * "Modes oversight" option was removed
    If you dont want ASProtect to show internal messages when mode is expired,
    or in case of BlackListed keys entered by the user and want to handle this
    situations by yourself for specific mode, you should turn "Don`t use built-in dialogs" option on (Modes tab).
  * ASProtect now saves only one registration key for each mode
  * SaveKey API was removed
  * ASProtect SDK header files (API functions prototypes and TModeStatus structure)
    were changed
  + New option added to the IDE project selection window: "Dont show ide dialog"
  + Added automatic encryption sections processing by polymorphic markers
  + ASProtect SKE envelope layer size is increased to 200Kb due to new protection technics
  + GetModeInformation API is changed:

    CODE function  GetModeInformation(     ModeID     : Byte;
                                       var ModeName   : PChar;
                                       var ModeStatus : TModeStatus ): Boolean; stdcall;

    Now its possible to get information for any mode installed by using new parameter 
    "ModeID" (Mode identifier)

  + Added new TModeStatus state - "ModeID"
  + Added new simple VB example with several modes usage

  ASProtect 2.1 SKE build 02.19 Release
  =====================================
  - Fixed CRC calculation error for some files
  - Fixed the problem with change of active mode 
  + WinCGI keygenerator was added

  ASProtect 2.0 SKE build 02.15 Release
  =====================================
  + Added command line support ("-process" key)
  + New modes states tracking optinon added:
    MainMenu -> Options -> Modes statuses oversight

    If you want ASProtect to stop tracking modes states, you should turn this
    option off. After that you will have to process all mode states by yourself.

  + Added BlackListed registration keys support for IDE Debug logger
  + Add OutputDebugString IDE logging for service applications testing
  + Added ASProtect Main Window minimization feature
  + Added new ASProtect API - "GetKeyDate"

    "GetKeyDate" API Description:

    GetKeyExpirationDate

    Description: 

    GetKeyExpirationDate - retrieves the creation date for registration key
    of the currently working mode. If the function succeeds, the return value
    is TRUE. If current mode is not using activation keys or there is no
    registration key installed, the function will fail and return FALSE.

    Declaration: 

    For Delphi: 

    function  GetKeyDate    ( var Day   : WORD;
                              var Month : WORD;
                              var Year  : WORD ): Boolean; stdcall;

    Sample: 

    For Delphi:

    Var
      Day,
      Month,
      Year  : WORD;

    begin
      GetKeyDate( Day, Month, Year );
      Form.Caption := Format('Key Creation Date: %d/%d/%d', [Day, Month, Year]);
    end;

  * Fixed right mouse click problem on About Box
  * Improved "Advanced Import protection" option
  * "Is this Mode registered?" caption changed to "Is this Mode in Registered state?".
  * Improved "CheckSum Protection" option
  * Improved ASProtect Keygen random generator
  * Interface changes: encryption sections are now opening in new modal window

  * ASProtect API function "GetModeInformation" was changed!

    In order to check mode states after calling ASProtect API functions:
    ("CheckKeyAndDecrypt" and "CheckKey") use new boolean parameter in
    "GetModeInformation" API function - "CurrMode". If it is set to "True",
    function will return current mode states, otherwise it will return the
    states of last key-mode checking operation.

    Declaration for Delphi:
    procedure GetModeInformation( var ModeName   : PChar;
                                  var ModeStatus : TModeStatus;
                                      CurrMode   : Boolean ); stdcall;
    Declaration for C++:
    extern "C" _stdcall __declspec(dllimport)
    BOOL GetModeInformation(char** ModeName, PMODE_STATUS mode_status, BOOL CurrMode);
