It is very easy protect your application with SVK very well.
You can encrypt some blocks of code and these parts will not
possible decrypt without correct registration key. If you use
Hardare ID of the computer to lock registration key, then this
key will work only for this one computer.
I wrote examples for Masm, Delphi and Visual C++. Of course You
can use this method of protection in other compilers too. 
It is very easy use it and it is very secure way how protect some
functions in your application. 
If user will not have correct registration key or he will not have
correct computer for which was registration key created, there will 
show message box with message: "This function is not implemented in 
UNREGISTERED version. Please register it!" and Hardware ID for this 
computer.

Note: Please check special example for Visual Basic!

Note2: If you call SVKP_GetHWInfo function, program must be protected
by SVKP. Hardware ID check box in Key Protection menu must be checked
before encryption of file.
