Today's problem protections like SVKP is dumping.
Crackers wait when protected application is decoded
in memory and then with special programs (dumpers)
dump it from memory. 
SVKP uses some technics against dumping. But if
you use special blocks is protected application
more secure and it isn't easy dump it correct.

You can use two types of encrypted blocks:

Type1 - these blocks are decrypted before using
and after use encrypted again

Type2 - these blocks are decrypted before using
and after use removed. This mean, encrypted code
is not possible call again!!

Note: Don't use this method in Visual Basic !
