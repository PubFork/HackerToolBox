Sometimes You want to communicate with protection.
Easy and very good a way are SVKP's API functions. There
I wrote examples for Masm, Delphi, Visual C++ and Visual Basic. 
Ofcourse You can use this method of protection in other 
compilers too, but maybe it will be possible after some changes
in include and library files. If You will have any problems
with another compiler, please contact me and I will try help 
You.
For API functions specification please read documentation.
