It is very easy protect your application with SVK very well.
You can encrypt some blocks of code and these parts will not
possible decrypt without correct registration key. I wrote 
examples for Masm, Delphi and Visual C++. Of course You can use
this method of protection in other compilers too. 
It is very easy use it and it is very secure way how protect some
functions in your application. 
If user will not have correct registration key, there will not show
message box. Protected code will not proceed.


Note: Don't use this method in Visual Basic !
