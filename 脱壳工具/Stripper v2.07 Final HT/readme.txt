stripper 2.07 final - unpacker for aspr 1.2x and aspack 2.xx.

* what is new in 2.07ht
   - added support for HT processors (engine.sys was upgraded to engine 
     from version 2.13);

* what is new in 2.07
   - new IceExt friendly driver engine.sys;
   
* what is new in 2.05

   - the stolen bytes are scrambled now. stripper does not restore original 
     stolen bytes, only copies them (scrambled) to new section. 
     you have to restore them by yourself (if you want). but I do my best 
     to make unpacked program working with damaged ones.

* features:

   -   unpacking asprotected`ed programs (exe, dll, ocx);
   -   unpacking aspacked`ed programs (exe, dll, ocx) - use stripper 2.05;
   -   rebuilding resources section;
   -   cleaning up the victim program (deleting aspr sections);
   -   doing some researching of packed program;

* requirements:

   - stripper works only under 2k and XP, also you must have 
     administrator's rights;
   - there will be no win9x version;
   - SoftIce with "i3here on" for using reversing tool and loader;
