Info:
-----
UnPECompact is an Unpacker for exe files which have been compressed with
PECompact. It should unpack all PECompact versions.


Known bugs:
-----------
UnPECompact isn't able to unpack pecompact.exe because the depack code differs
a bit and it has also sometimes some strange dll imports.
It's sometimes not very fast... sorry.
There are some trial PECompact version which put a nag messagebox into the packed
file. If the unpacked file doesn't run then try unpacking the file without optimizing
the filesize. Especially under win NT/2k causes that sometimes probs.
...or try to enable "Force full IAT rebuilding".
