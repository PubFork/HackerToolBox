HideToolz v2.2

The original author of HideToolz is Ms-Rem.  I don't think he maintains HideToolz anymore.  This is a really useful tool... =)  Most of the
code put in public domain by Ms-Rem is excellent and one of a kind.

Anyway...

I have modified the driver to work with newer version of Windows, from Vista SP1+ ... due to the changes, this version no longer works
with Windows 2000.  So if you want to use HideToolz with Windows 2000, download v2.1

HideToolz v2.1 -->> http://www.woodmann.com/collaborative/tools/images/Bin_HideToolz_2.1_2008-10-24_21.13_HideToolz.rar



VISTA USERS:

If you are running Vista SP1+ you need to apply the vista shutdown fix\shutdown_fix_vista_only.reg to
the registry and reboot BEFORE running HideToolz.  This patch disables kernel paging of device drivers, and fixes the problem
with BSOD at shutdown.  You may apply this patch simply by double clicking the file and clicking "Yes" - this will set:

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management

DisablePagingExecutive from its default of 0 to 1.


If you experience any BSOD from HideToolz, tell me about it ?  fyyre@nightmail.ru
