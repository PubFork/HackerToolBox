; Update: v0.11: Fixed bug like 10 minutes after initial release.
;		thanks to nIabI for testing.
; 	  v0.12: Optimized lzrw1 decompression code some
; 	  v0.13: Rewrote lzrw1 decompression procedure, vast improvement.
;		 Removed NULLing of destination buffer, not necessary
;		 I don't think.
;	  v0.14: +Fixed bug in LCC-WIN32 applications, where physical 
;	   	 size of of sections is, surprisingly enough, not aligned.
;		 +No longer flagged by AVP as suspicious.
;	  v0.20: +Removes reloc table because it's not viable anymore 
;		 anyway. This should cause no problems except in DLLs.
;		 In other words, don't use this utility on DLLs.
;		 +Compresses all resource data following the last icon,
;		 group icon, or version information. In other words,
;		 as much as possible without removing the shell icon and
;		 version information and not having to restructure
;		 the entire resource section. v0.30 will restructure the
;		 import section to improve compression.
;                +Added compression of import table.
;		 +Removes debug information.
;                +Moved symbiont up to end of last section raw data.
;		 +Renamed to PCSHRINK.
;	 v0.26:  +Removes debug directory rva and size.
;		 +Resource section restructuring added!
;		 +Bug fix: I imported my resource type equates from 
;		  windows.inc. Turns out the RT_GROUPICON was wrong,
;		  causing some applications to lose their shell icon
;		  after compression.
;		 +Fixed alignfile bug where handle was being closed.
;	 v0.28:  +Added GUI
;		 +Added option to not restructure resource data
;		 +Added merging capabilities of first two sections.		 
;		 +TiTi/Blizzard suggested and coded an update for 
;		  vgalign. His update to the vgalign routine is 
;		  incorporated.
;	 v0.29:  +Fixed stack bug which caused blue screens in win9x.
;	 v0.30:  +Changed from LZRW1 to Jibz Compression Library. This
;		  significantly improves compression ratios.
;	 v0.31:  +Updated to APLib v0.22. This fixes the bug causing
;		  Win9x to lockup while compressing large files.
;	 v0.32:  +Bug fix: Incorrect image size on executables with
;  	          relocations in last section.
;		 +Now displays little error messagebox if there was
;		  a problem loading the host's original import table
;		  due to a missing DLL or export.
;	 v0.40:  +Bug fix: Section merging sometimes overwrote data.
;		 +Section merging now supported throughout exectuable.		 		 
;		 +Sections renamed to 'pcsX'.
;		 +Section merging is now done before compression,
;		  allowing for better compression ratios.		 
;	 v0.45	 +A large portion of the symbiont code is now 
;		  compressed.
;		 +Bug fix: If more than two section merges occured,
;		  only the first was saved in the SymbiontMergeTable.
;		 +Section merging no longer limited to two sections
;		  per merge. As many sequential, compressable sections
;		  as possible will be merged.		 
;		 +New, spiffy GUI with progress bar.
;	 v0.50   +Added file backup option
;		 +Added icon to dialog to fill an empty spot<g>.
;	 v0.51   +Bug Fix: involving Visual Basic apps with oddly
;		  named relocation sections.
;	 v0.60   +Removed dependency on fixup section to be named
;		  .reloc or .rloc.
;		 +Added user defined resource type compression, meaning
;		  the user can decide which resource type to compress 
;		  and which to leave alone.
;		 +Bug fix: TLS handling. (example: mirc32.exe)
;  	 v0.70   +Creation of thread for compression.
