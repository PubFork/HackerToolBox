	========================================================== 
	
 Phrozen Crew PE Shrinker is an windows 9x/NT executable file compressor, allowing compressed executables to run, functionally,
the same as always, but occupy a significantly less amount of 
disk space.

 Features:
   + Code, data, resource, and import directory compression.
   + Tight compression and fast decompression using Jibz Aplib v0.22.
   + Restructuring of resource data to improve compression ratios.
   + Preserves shell icon and version information.
   + Merging of compressable sections to reduce file alignment
     induced padding and to improve compression ratios.
   + Realigns, rebuilds, and trims executable before and after
     compression.
   + Removes debug information from executable.
   + win95/98/NT4/w2k compatible.
   
 Usage:
 PCSHRINK [filename]
   -filename is optional, specifing the file you wish to compress.
   
 Options:
 	[ ] Restructure Resource Data
 		- Some executables may make direct references
 		  to resource data, and therefore resource
 		  restructuring will not work. If you have
 		  any problems with the compressed executable,
 		  turn this option off.
        [ ] Merge Sections
        	- There should be no problems with section merging,
        	  but just in case I included the ability to turn
        	  this feature off.
        [ ] Backup File
        	- The original executable is copied to *.BAK before
        	  compression.
        	          	  
 			
 Warning on compressing DLLs:
  Compression of DLLs has not been truely added yet, however you
  may be able to compress DLLs as long as you rebase them to a 
  base which will ensure that no collision will occur with their
  associated applications. Support for relocations has not yet
  been added.
