 Legend:
  HV  - mode: view file as hex/ascii dump
  AV  - mode: view file as assembler instruction with codes
  TV  - mode: view file as text
  Î   - new feature.
  þ   - now it works.
  +   - changed.
  û   - works, but we don't no how. :)
  -   - coming soon.
  ~   - author's remark.

 + Generally corrected file QView.doc
 + Use left mouse button on filename (in the satus line) to call the file ma-
   nager (Similar to [Alt]+[F6]).
 + Paragraph alignment when centre the searched string in HV mode.
 + Default color for highlight group 5 in file manager changed: 11h -> 16h.
 + The start-up directory is restored on exit (if was changed in the file ma-
   nager).
 + Use 'pword ptr' signature in assembler/disassembler for the far indirect
   calls (32- or 48-bit pointer).
 + 'jmp di', 'call ecx', etc. instructions in assembler is now available.
 + 'File process bar' in 'String search' added.
 + [Esc] key to stop 'String search' process added in 'File process bar' .
 + Heap overflow control in file panel (over 2950 files available).
 + File sort by size/date&time in file panel is now rearrange files by
   size/dat&timee decrease.

                          Ver. 2.46.04-2.46.02
                        ÄÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÄ
 Î Windows 95/NT VxD 'LE'-header support (view).
 Î OS/2 'LX'header support (view).
 + Searched string is now placed in center line of screen in AV,HV mode.
 + Scrolling in History-box after record deletion was corrected.
 + Comments now outputted more correctly when non-zero Base Offset
 + Hide cursor on show 'About' & 'User Screen'
 + 'Relocations' & 'Overlay number' in MZ-Headers are replaced (placed for the
   correct position).
 Î File panel (file manager) on OpenFile ([Alt]+[F6]).
 Î File panel configuration file QView.fmg
 Î Viewed file scroll in HV,AV with [Ctrl]+[Left],[Ctrl]+[Right]. Current
   position is unchanged.
 + [Alt]+[Left],[Alt]+[Right] - go to previous/next comment [AV].
 + All offsets in LX,LE headers are viewed from the file begin.
 + Viewed file percents output was corrected.
 + Long commands code output was corrected [AV]
 Î [Alt]+[A] - mark whole file as a block [HV,AV]
 + Critical error handler (all errors are ignored ;)
 Î Call dump view at cursor offset from AV with [Alt]+[J]+[W] when 16-bit
   offset assumed or [Alt]+[J]+[D] - when 32-bit is.
   Return from HV to AV on call position with [Alt]+[J]

   Notation: here's the example of how it works:
   ~~~~~~~~
   1. AV
   000009A2: BA170B                    mov    dx,0B17
               ^^ cursor is here in AV, press Alt+J, W
   000009A5: B409                      mov    ah,09
   000009A7: CD21                      int    21

   2. Automatically goes to HV for the offset 0B17h:

   00000B17: 0A 0D 43 41³4C 43 20 5B³2F 3F 5D 5B³2F 73 5D 5B  ..CALC [/?][/s][
   00000B27: 2F 2A 5D 0A³0D 24 20 20³20 20 20 2F³73 20 2D 20  /*]..$     /s -

   Scroll it however you want, then press Alt+J to go back to 1.

 + Documentation was corrected.
 + The format of .CRK files QView saves was reduced to the standard.
 Î Function of upgrade the current file with the crack file information.
   Call: [Ctrl]+[F8]
   Work:
           1. The first dialog requires the base address of crack. It is
              only needed in case to change the base address stored in crack
              file. The address you put here becomes the base (first)
              address, and all the other crack addresses are changed by the
              required offset automatically.

           2. The second dialog requires the crack file name.

   N.B.:
           1. The crack file format is fixed !!! It must include the crack
              only, i.e. the strings like this: '12345678: 12 34',0Dh,0Ah.
              First eight characters are the crack address (offset) - use the
              leading '0' if required; then ':' followed by the Space symbol;
              then two numbers devided by space: the old byte & the new byte.
              The every string should be ended with 0Dh,0Ah (Cariage Return
              and Line Feed characters).

           2. Program takes the full crack syntax controll. If the string
              causes the problem, it's number is outputed. The problem may
              occure in a two cases: if the string syntax illegal and if the
              old byte in the crack file not equal to found in the current
              file one. The byte is changed only if all the requirements
              are satisfied.

 Î The strings dump output to file in the TV with [Shift]+[F3]
 Î ICEBP command (opcode F1h) disassembler (AV)
 Î The screen output to file with [Alt]+[P] (TV,HV,AV)
 + Assembler instruction of [d32+IR*F] type analis bug fixed.
   (N.B. The d32 field must be of 2 symbols minimum)
 + [IR*F] address instruction assembler, i.e. d32=0.
 + [IR*F] address disassembler (was 'IR*F]' ;)
 + The [ESC] key function in 'CharSet' & 'LineFeed' dialogs was corrected
 + The file Qview.hlp corrected according to the current keys functions
 Î The file changes saved in .CRK-type file with [Shift]+[F9].
 Î New mask symbol '@' in assembler search - substring search.
   Examples:
    1. search mask            : @bx*,*
       possible instructions  : mov bx,5092
                                xor word ptr [bx+si],ax
                                etc.
    2. search mask            : @[bx+si+1024]*
       possible instructions  : test word ptr [bx+si+1024],5092
                                xor byte ptr [bx+si+1024],al
                                mov ax,word ptr [bx+si+1024]
                                etc.

 Î The system time shown when [Shift] pressed   (TV,HV,AV)
 Î The system date shown when [Ctrl] pressed    (TV,HV,AV)
 Î In the TV mode you may save the current file as recoded. Use [F9] key.
   N.B. Do not save the file with the same name!
 Î User-defined caracter redefinition table support applied. You may define up
   to a 4 tables (encoding) in addition to the standard tree tables. Refer the
   QVIEW.ENG to learn about the QVIEW.CHR format.
 + Mouse cursor is now placed in the left up corner of the screen at start-up.
 + Some gifts
 Î Backward search mode is added. Use [F9] to define the search direction.
