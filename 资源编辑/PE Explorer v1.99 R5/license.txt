   about-to-be-installed SOFTWARE you are agreeing to be bound by the terms 
   of this End User License Agreement. You assume responsibility for the 
   selection of the SOFTWARE to achieve your intended results, and for the 
   installation, use and result obtained from the SOFTWARE. Do not use the 
   SOFTWARE in any case where significant damage or injury to persons, 
   property or business may happen if an error occurs. If you do not agree

  1. LICENSE GRANT.

    Heaventools grants to you a nonexclusive license to use one copy 
    of the version of this SOFTWARE on one personal computer or other
    device located within your home or office for as many licenses as 
    you purchase. "You" means the company, entity or individual whose 
    funds are used to pay the license fee. "Use" means storing, loading,
    installing, executing or displaying the SOFTWARE. If you install 
    the SOFTWARE onto a multi-user platform or network, each and every
    individual user of the SOFTWARE must be licensed separately or be
    covered by a site license.
    You may not modify the SOFTWARE or disable any licensing or
    control features of the SOFTWARE except as an intended part of
    the SOFTWARE's programming features. When you first obtain a copy
    of the SOFTWARE, you are granted an evaluation period of not more
    than 30 days, after which time you must pay for the SOFTWARE
    according to the terms and prices discussed in the SOFTWARE's
    documentation, or you must remove the SOFTWARE from your computer.
    This license is not transferable to any other hardware product or
    other company, entity, or individual. You are expected to use the
    SOFTWARE on your system and to thoroughly evaluate its usefulness
    and functionality before making a purchase.
    This "try before you buy" approach is the ultimate guarantee that
    the SOFTWARE will perform to your satisfaction.

    You may process any number of PE files using the SOFTWARE, provided
    that such processed output be used internally for evaluation purposes
    only. You may not distribute or publish any of your products that 
    are processed by the SOFTWARE using this evaluation version of
    SOFTWARE. You must obtain a full commercial License for the SOFTWARE
    in order for you to distribute or incorporate and processed works
    produced while utilizing this evaluation version of the SOFTWARE.

    Any use of the SOFTWARE which is illegal under international or
    local law is forbidden by this licence. You agree that you will not 
    use this software to decompile, reverse engineer, or dissasemble any
    third party software whose License expressly prohibits such reverse
    engineering activities. In addition, you must indemnify and defend
    Heaventools from and against any claims or lawsuits, including
    attorneys' fees that arise from or result from your use of this software
    in a manner that violates any of the terms of this or any other License
    agreement.

    DAMAGES OR CLAIMS. THE PERSON USING THE SOFTWARE BEARS
    ALL RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE

    THE ENTIRE COST OF ANY SERVICE AND REPAIR.

    SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION

    as valid, but in any event the validity or enforceability of the 
    remainder hereof shall not be affected.

  7. NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. 

    IN NO EVENT SHALL HEAVENTOOLS OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE
    TO YOU FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
    INDIRECT DAMAGES OF ANY KIND ARISING OUT OF THE DELIVERY,
    PERFORMANCE OR USE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF HEAVENTOOLS
    HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO
    EVENT WILL HEAVENTOOLS' LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM, WHETHER IN
    CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY OF LIABILITY, EXCEED

    COMBINATION, OPERATION OR OTHERWISE WITH THE DATA OR
    MATERIALS NOT SUPPLIED BY HEAVENTOOLS.

    This EULA (including any addendum or amendment to this EULA which 
    is included with the Software) is the entire agreement between you 
    and Heaventools relating to the Software and the support services 
    (if any) and they supersede all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
    written communications, proposals and representations with respect 
    to the Software or any other subject matter covered by this EULA. 
    To the extent the terms of any Heaventools policies or programs for
    support services conflict with the terms of this EULA, the terms of 
    this EULA shall control. If any provision of this EULA is held to be
    void, invalid, unenforceable or illegal, the other provisions shall

 10. RESERVED RIGHTS.

    and/or the respective authors (listed either in the documentation
    or within the SOFTWARE).

    Heaventools reserves the right to make exceptions to any of these
    conditions, or alter these conditions, at any time. However, you
    may always use these conditions instead of any altered version if
    you prefer (note that this licence explicitly applies only to one
    version of the program; therefore, if Heaventools makes new
    conditions in connection with a future version, you do not then have
    the right to apply these conditions to that version instead).
