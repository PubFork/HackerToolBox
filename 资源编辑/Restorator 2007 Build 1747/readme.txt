Restorator 2007 Update 2
========================

Welcome to Restorator!

OVERVIEW
========
Restorator is a resource editor for Windows. You can edit
resources directly in the executable, e.g. by opening a .exe
file. Main usage:
- For localizing (translating) programs:
  Restorator allows to localize entire applications:
  you can edit all resources that contain text, and translate
  them to different languages. Also, with an external image
  editor, you can translate texts that appear in images.
- As a resource editor:
  For developers - manage efficiently your .res, .dcr and
  other files containing resources
- As a skin editor:
  modify the user interface of Windows 32-bit programs
  and create your own custom application

Restorator makes it easy to view, extract, and change resources like
images, icons, text, menus, dialogs, version, sounds, animations, and
many more. Among the file types understood by Restorator are exe, dll,
res/rc (resource files), ocx (Active X), scr (screen saver), dcr (delphi
component resource) and many other file types. See the help for a
complete listing.
